				<h2>UFront example series</h2>
				<p>A series of example projects showcasing the <a href="https://github.com/ufront/ufront">UFront</a> library - a powerful MVC framework for web development in Haxe.</p>
				<p>This project is a documentation effort with the aim of demystifying an unfortunately obscure library. The <a href="https://github.com/dstrekelj/ufront-example-HelloWorld">first example</a> is currently available.</p>

				<h2>TOCHKA</h2>
				<p><a href="/tochka/">TOCHKA</a> is a very simple video game  written in Haxe using the <a href="http://haxepunk.com/">HaxePunk</a> library. It was developed as part of my bachelor's thesis on cross-platform computer game development. The goal of the game is to dodge incoming obstacles for as long as possible in order to attain the high score.</p>
				<p>The game's source code is <a href="https://github.com/dstrekelj/tochka">freely available</a>.</p>
