# Hello, World!

Hi there!

Welcome to my personal page. This one was created as a single-page application of sorts, using [Haxe][1] and targeting JavaScript. All of the content, _including articles_, is fetched from a [repository][2] on GitHub via the [GitHub API][3]. Pretty neat!

In the coming days I'll write up a short guide on how to create your own GitHub powered blog. The source code to this one will be released as well. I'd publish it now, but it still needs some polish.

For comments, questions, or criticism, please get in touch via mail (in the sidebar!) or by [opening a new issue][4].

Until next time,

Domagoj
